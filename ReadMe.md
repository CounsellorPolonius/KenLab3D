Ken's Labyrinth
=============

Ken's Labyrinth is a first-person shooter DOS game, released in 1993 by Epic MegaGames (now called Epic Games). It was mostly coded by Ken Silverman, who went on to design the Build engine that was used for rendering a first-person viewpoint in Apogee Software's Duke Nukem 3D. It consists of three episodes, the first of which was released as shareware - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%27s_Labyrinth).

## What is this fork? 

I found the on-screen controls to be too distracting. I modified it so that they are invisible. I intend to use this with a gamepad mapper anyways so having the controls invisible works for me.  

You can download APK-package from the Releases section. 

You can also open this project in Android Studio IDE and build the APK-package by using this program. I modified the gradle version in the project.
